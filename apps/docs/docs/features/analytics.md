# Analytics

Zap.ts provides built-in analytics to help you understand user behavior, _track events_, and _monitor your app’s performance_. Fort that, we use [PostHog](https://posthog.com/) and [Vercel Analytics](https://vercel.com/docs/analytics) for analytics by default.

## Overview

- **Custom events:** Easily track custom events and user actions.
- **Extensible:** Swap out or extend analytics providers as needed.
- **Zero-config:** Vercel Analytics and Speed Insights are enabled by default.

## Providers

### Vercel Analytics

Zap.ts uses [Vercel Analytics](https://vercel.com/docs/analytics) for out-of-the-box pageview and performance tracking.  

It is automatically included in your app layout and requires no setup if you deploy on Vercel.

### Vercel Speed Insights

[Speed Insights](https://vercel.com/docs/speed-insights) provides real user performance metrics, helping you optimize your app’s loading and interaction times.

### PostHog

[PostHog](https://posthog.com/) is used for advanced event tracking, user analytics, and product insights.  

It is integrated via a custom `Providers` component that initializes PostHog only if the feature is enabled.

1. **Initialization:** PostHog is set up using your environment variables.
2. **Pageviews:** Pageview tracking is handled by the `SuspendedPostHogPageView` component.
3. **Custom Events:** You can track custom events anywhere in your app using **PostHog SDK**.

To use PostHog, set the appropriate environment variables (`NEXT_PUBLIC_POSTHOG_KEY` and `NEXT_PUBLIC_POSTHOG_HOST`) and enable the feature flag in `zap.config.ts`.

For more, see the [PostHog documentation](https://posthog.com/docs).
