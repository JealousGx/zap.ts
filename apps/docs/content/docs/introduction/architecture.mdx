title: Architecture
description: Here is the complete architecture of a Zap.ts application compared to a traditional Next.js application.
---
# Overview

Zap.ts architecture is designed to be modular, scalable, and easy to maintain. It leverages the power of TypeScript and modern web development practices to provide a robust foundation for building applications.

Since Zap.ts is built on top of [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/), it inherits all the features and benefits of the Next.js framework while introducing its own conventions and best practices.

Below, we will compare the architecture of a Zap.ts application with that of a traditional Next.js application.

## Architecture Comparison
