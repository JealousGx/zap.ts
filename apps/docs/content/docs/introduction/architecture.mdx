description: Here is the complete architecture of a Zap.ts application compared to a traditional Next.js application.

# Architecture Overview

Zap.ts architecture is designed to be modular, scalable, and easy to maintain. It leverages the power of TypeScript and modern web development practices to provide a robust foundation for building applications.

Since Zap.ts is built on top of [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/), it inherits all the features and benefits of the Next.js framework while introducing its own conventions and best practices.

Below, we will compare the architecture of a Zap.ts application with that of a traditional Next.js application.

## Modified

These files/folders depending on your Next.js configuration (choice of linter, etc) can already be present in your project, but we modified them to fit the Zap.ts architecture and philosophy.

- `biome.json`: Configuration file for [Biome](https://biomejs.dev/), a linter and code formatter. We're using [Ultracite](https://ultracite.ai/) preset for better collaborations between AI and developers.
- `next.config.ts`: Configuration file for [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) with additional settings for [CSP (Content Security Policy)](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/CSP), [Permissions Policy](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Headers/Permissions-Policy), defining [Typed Routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/config/next-config-js/typedRoutes) by default, additional [security headers](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/config/next-config-js/headers), configuration for [sw.js](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/guides/progressive-web-apps#5-creating-a-service-worker), [MDX](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/guides/mdx) and [Bundle Analyzer](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/getting-started/linking-and-navigating#hydration-not-completed).
- `package.json`: Configuration file for [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) with additional scripts for [Biome](https://biomejs.dev/), [Drizzle ORM](https://orm.drizzle.team/), [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/), [React Email](https://react.email/) and more. Also includes `lint-staged` configuration with [Ultracite](https://ultracite.ai/) preset. Finally, it adds dependencies to support Zap.ts architecture.
- `public/`: Removed [Vercel](https://vercel.com/) default files and added `sw.js` for [PWA (Progressive Web App)](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/guides/progressive-web-apps) support with [push notification](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Push_API) events and [Geist](https://vercel.com/font) font for [Open Graph](https://og-image.vercel.app/) images. Also added standard files for a better [SEO (Search Engine Optimization)](https://developers.google.com/search/docs/fundamentals/seo-starter-guide).

## Additions

These files/folders are not typically present in a standard Next.js project, but we added them to enhance the Zap.ts architecture and philosophy.

- `.cursor/`: Contains [MCP (Model Context Protocol)](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/) that allows LLMs in [Cursor](https://cursor.com/) to get more context with external services such as [Supabase](https://supabase.com/), [PostHog](https://posthog.com/), and more.
- `.cursorignore`: Similar to `.gitignore`, this file specifies which files and directories should be ignored by [Cursor](https://cursor.com/).
- `.dockerignore`: Similar to `.gitignore`, this file specifies which files and directories should be ignored by [Docker](https://www.docker.com/).
- `.github/`: Contains [GitHub](https://github.com/) specific files such as workflows for CI/CD, instructions for [Copilot](https://github.com/features/copilot).
- `.gitignore`: Specifies which files and directories should be ignored by [Git](https://git-scm.com/).
- `.npmrc`: Configuration file for [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/).
- `.vscode/`: Contains [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) specific settings and configurations such as [MCP (Model Context Protocol)](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/), debugging configurations, and more.
- `.windsurf/`: Contains [Windsurf](https://windsurf.com/) specific settings and configurations such as [MCP (Model Context Protocol)](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/).
- `Dockerfile`: Contains the instructions for building a Docker image for the application following [Next.js Docker best practices](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/examples/with-docker).
- `components.json`: Configuration file for [shadcn/ui](https://ui.shadcn.com/), a set of accessible and customizable React components.
- `drizzle.config.*.ts`: Configuration files for [Drizzle ORM](https://orm.drizzle.team/), an ORM for TypeScript and JavaScript with separate config for development and production environments.
- `emails/`: Contains email templates and allows for easy customization and management of email content through a mail server using [React Email](https://react.email/).
- `next-sitemap.config.js`: Configuration file for [next-sitemap](https://github.com/iamvishnusankar/next-sitemap), a sitemap generation tool for Next.js applications.
