# What is Next.js?

Next.js is a popular React framework that enables **server-side rendering** and **static site generation** out of the box. It simplifies building React applications by handling routing, code splitting, and performance optimizations automatically.

## Key Features

- **File-based routing:** Create pages by adding files in the `pages/` directory.
- **Server-side rendering (SSR):** Render pages on the server for faster initial load and better SEO.
- **Static site generation (SSG):** Pre-render pages at build time.
- **API routes:** Build backend endpoints inside your Next.js app.
- **Fast refresh:** Instant feedback while developing.

## Example

Here is a simple Next.js page:

```jsx
export default function Home() {
  return (
    <main>
      <h1>Welcome to Next.js!</h1>
      <p>This is a server-rendered React app.</p>
    </main>
  );
}
```

## Why use Next.js?

Next.js reduces the complexity of setting up React projects with SSR and SSG, making your apps faster and more SEO-friendly without extra configuration.
